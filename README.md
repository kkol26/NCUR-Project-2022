# NCUR-Project-2022
For entry into the National Council on Undergraduate Research in 2022, I performed research on the impact of Gambling amongst youth in Ghana. Using machine learning, I managed to create a predictor for the outcome of football matches in Europe's top 5 leagues. The predictor was to serve the purpose of providing more information to the gamblers about the game outcome. To add, an application was designed to provide pictures that serve as a psychological deterrent to continue betting.
